Given a 2D array rooks of length n, where rooks[i] = [xi, yi] indicates the position of a rook on an n x n chess board. Your task is to move the rooks 1 cell at a time vertically or horizontally (to an adjacent cell) such that the board becomes peaceful.

A board is peaceful if there is exactly one rook in each row and each column.

Return the minimum number of moves required to get a peaceful board.

Note that at no point can there be two rooks in the same cell.

Example 1:

Input: rooks = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,1]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: rooks = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]

Output: 6

Explanation:

Constraints:

1 <= n == rooks.length <= 500
0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
The input is generated such that there are no 2 rooks in the same cell.
